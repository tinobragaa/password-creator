The website was deployed through the use of GitHub Pages, a feature built in to GitHub. This can be done by following the steps below.
1. In the desired repository, click on "Settings" from the top menu.
2. From the side menu to your left, select "Pages" in the "Code and automation" section.
3. Make sure the "Source" option is set to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select the desired "Branch" from the drop down below (main branch in most cases, making sure the director is set to /(root)).
5. Select "Save", and after it refreshes the page, you will see a box at the top of the page providing you with the URL of your now published site.

To contribute or check the code yourself, you can fork or clone the repository as well.

### Fork
1. Go to the desired repository
2. Click "Fork" in the upper right corner
3. Select the owner, and set the repository name. A description can be added if desired
4. Choose whether to copy the default branch, or all branches
5. Click "Create Form"

### Clone

1. Go to the desired repository
2. Click the "Code" button at the top of the files section of the page
3. Select your desired method for cloning (HTTPS/SSH/GitHub CLI)
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory
6. Type "git clone", and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of "YOUR-USERNAME": "$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/DESIRED-REPOSITORY"
7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

### Heroku
